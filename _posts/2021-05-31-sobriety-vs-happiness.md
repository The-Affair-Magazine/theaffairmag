Sobriety has been a hot topic in my family, and in many families throughout the world. With nearly half of all American families either knowing someone or being related to someone with addiction problems it’s important to focus on this question: should we ignore this problem as long as they are happy?
My brother is a drug addict. He has been to rehab three times and is still not sober. I was so young when my brother, who’s 4 years older than me, began to have substance abuse problems. I was forced into maturity, but I didn't understand the gravity of the situation. I just understood that my mom was trying to control my brother and make him unhappy, as my brother would tell me. If you asked me then, as a 12-year-old, what was more important: sobriety or happiness? I would probably tell you happiness. However,  I am 16 now, and I have seen the full devastation addiction can have on a family.

Although someone who is under the influence of drugs may be happy at the moment, the people around them aren't. I have cried countless tears over my brother whenever I have found out that he has relapsed, and it still hurts the same every time. I understand the stress my parents have gone through, trying to control a teenage drug addict. 

As someone who has gone through being close to someone who struggles with substance abuse, I can say with absolute clarity that sobriety is more important than happiness. Sobriety should be the base of your life, not your lifeline. Being under the influence, although you get the rush of dopamine, is not true happiness. There should never be the argument, “at least they are happy,” when it comes to drug or alcohol abuse. Supporting happiness over sobriety promotes an unhealthy lifestyle and puts your loved ones at risk for alcohol poisoning and drug overdose.
