The coronavirus has changed the way the world functions on a day-to-day basis. People’s lives around the world have come to a halt, causing work and school to be done from home. Leisure activities, such as traveling and visiting museums, are no longer an option. However, many museums have made visiting and exploring a possibility through virtual museum tours. From the comfort of one’s home, visiting a local museum or a museum in a country on the other side of the world is just a few clicks away. Virtual museum tours can be used as a tool for learning how to cope with the psychological effects of the coronavirus as well.

A study took place over three months in Italy, the first country in Europe to close down in order to mitigate the outcome of the virus. The study targeted three different psychological problems: the stress of the disease, the disappearance of places, and the crisis of a sense of community (Riva and Wiederhold, 2020). With 400 participants, the researchers investigated the effects of virtual reality on mindfulness and the anxiety surrounding the coronavirus (Stieg, 2020). They suggest that virtual reality can provide a place of comfort and safety during a time of solitude. The coronavirus has isolated a majority of people, causing a loss of a sense of community. Virtual reality, including virtual museum tours, can help people feel connected to the outside world during this time of crisis. 

One of the companies helping connect people with virtual tours of museums, monuments, and more, is Google. Google Arts & Culture is partnering with over 2500 cultural and educational institutions from around the world, bringing art and educational experiences to anyone who is interested. Virtual tours of The British Museum in London, England; the Guggenheim Museum in New York, United States; the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Seoul, South Korea; and many more are offered through the Google Arts & Culture website for free (Romano, 2020). For those who are studying from home as well as those who had vacations and trips canceled due to the virus, virtual museum tours provided by Google help continue the educational experience while having safety as the main priority. Although Google Arts & Culture can help create museum tours, some museums have created their own virtual tours without Google. For example, the Louvre from Paris, France, offers tours from their museum website. The Van Gogh Museum website is also offering virtual tours of its museum, which includes many things such as school lessons and van Gogh collection highlights. 

Due to the extra time many people have on their hands, the Google Arts & Culture and other virtual museum tour websites have witnessed an increase in traffic. Hauser & Wirth, a Swiss modern art gallery, had 200,000 visits in only three weeks, while having had one million visits total in all of last year. The British Museum collection page went from around 2,000 daily visits to 75,000 daily visits (Shehadi, 2020). People at home because of the virus are taking advantage of the opportunities presented by these virtual tours.
