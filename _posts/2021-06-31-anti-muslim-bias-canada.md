Recently, a driver intentionally ran over a family of 5 and killed a father, mother, grandmother, and daughter in Ontario on the basis of their religion, Islam. Because of this, a boy is  now an orphan. This killing has caused an outcry for the government to take action  regarding the hate crimes against Muslims. Mohamed Salih, a member of London’s City Council, has said, “Even after this, there are still people saying that Islamophobia doesn’t exist. The challenge and a reality we must face is that far too often in our city, there is Islamophobia. It’s something we’ve known for far too long.”
	
After lifting COVID-19 restrictions for a few hours, Justin Trudeau, Canada’s Prime Minister, went to a memorial for the family, along with thousands of people. At the vigil, Trudeau said, “Islamophobia is real. Racism is real. We must stand together and say no to hatred.” 
	
Nathaniel Veltman, the driver, was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. The London police have said they are consulting the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the attorney general regarding potential terrorism charges. The police have said that these attacks were targeted toward Muslims and were a “planned, premeditative act”.
	
Canada has a reputation for tolerance and has even welcomed Syrian refugees. However, Canada continues to ignore the rising hate towards Muslims. The Canadian Security and Intelligence Service reported that “the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated xenophobic and anti-authority narratives, many of which may directly or indirectly impact national security considerations.” In 2019, the police reported 1,946 hate crimes in Canada:those made against Muslims rose 10% from 2018.
