We’ve all seen it: Black Lives Matter posts on our stories, black screens rushing through our feed, and endless Tik Toks (if you’re anything like me) about Black Lives Matter. In this new age of information, the media isn’t the only thing being affected. 
Art is “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form… producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.” As defined by our favorite information hub, Google. In this time of rampant emotion: anger, grief, hopelessness, and triumph, what is a better way to outlet feelings than to do art? Art is a way to crystalize hope for change. During the Black Lives Matter movement,, art immortalizes the possibility for political change, and the tear down of structural racism, quite literally. Back when the confederate statues were built, they immortalized the push to keep slavery. Now, in 2020, the tear-down of these statues represent a new era, a time when structural racism has been torn down, and a new wave of civil rights prevails. 

After George Floyd’s death, art has taken on a new meaning. Art has become a way to protest, and a way to crystalize the human condition, inequality. Hundreds, if not thousands, of artists have painted murals dedicated to George Floyd. Makeshift memorials, posters, T-shirts, and many other works of art have been created. Perhaps, one of the most recognizable ones is art written on the street leading up to the White House. Mayor Muriel Bowser had “Black Lives Matter” written in yellow block letters on Sixteenth Street, as a way of memorializing the movement. While protesters on the street may be pushed away by tear gas and mace, the yellow block letters which spell out “Black Lives Matter” are permanent. While the Black Lives Matter protests may end, Sixteenth Street will be permanently changed, through art. These are the letters that represent this new wave of Civil Rights.

Another iconic example of street art which has been done to memorialize George Floyd  is Xena Goldman, Greta McLain, and Cadex Herrera’s portrait of George Floyd, placed on a wall of “Cup Foods,” the location at which George Floyd was suffocated. The mural features a portrait of Floyd, his name, the names of many others who faced police brutality, and a quote saying “I can breathe now.” Hundreds of people honor this mural with flowers, posters, and other works of art. This iconic mural crystalized a fight for justice, and a feeling of triumph. Through art, we have immortalized the change of human condition, from inequality to equality, and hope. 

While our Instagram stories will be gone after twenty-four hours, and our posts will be gone from everyone’s feed after two days, the labor and emotion that goes into creating a piece of artwork is permanent. Art is intrinsic to displaying the human condition, and is a vessel to immortalize our voices, our struggles, and our triumphs. Art sees you, art hears you, and art holds truth.
