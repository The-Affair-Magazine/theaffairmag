Everyone has experienced good and bad moods. What makes people with bipolar disorder different is that people with this disorder have very extreme mood swings. A teenager who experiences bipolar disorder will experience drastic emotional changes; from manic to depressive. It also could be the opposite. In some cases, emotional changes can occur in the absence of a normal phase.  People with Bipolar Disorder will experience a normal phase first. Bipolar sufferers can also experience feelings of mania and depression at the same time. Until now the cause of bipolar disorder is not fully understood; the most reliable cause is proper to genetic nature.                                                                                                                
1. Manic Episodes: These manic episodes often alternate between periods of depression. In this phase, the person feels increased energy, creativity, and euphoria. And, Mania can be mild, moderate, or severe. They generally last for weeks or months and are usually separated by episodes of health.
2. Depressive Episodes: Depressive episodes that alternate with a less severe form of mania called hypomania. The sufferer will feel hopeless, sad, or empty.

This person with bipolar disorder has a unique story, which means that every person with bipolar disorder experiences different things. Most importantly, each person with Bipolar has made healthy choices for themselves.
For those of you who are bipolar, you don't need to feel alone. More than 45 million people in the world also suffer from bipolar disorder, which indirectly means you have more than 45 million friends. 

## What Bipolar feels like:                             	
One person with bipolar disorder says that when he is in 'Mania,' he has a lot of energy and doesn't want to stop. When they are in their 'Mania' phase, people with bipolar disorder are very dominant in a conversation, feel they can do anything, and act like clowns who entertain many people.

But if the Bipolar person is in the 'Depression' phase, the Bipolar person often cuts ties with many people and chooses to isolate themselves. 

They don't say much, lose motivation, and get irritated easily. The person with Bipolar does this for nothing because they felt that at the time, whatever they do will be considered wrong by many parties.

Remember, if you have bipolar disorder and  are in a 'depression' phase, don't think about ending your life. This phase is only temporary and if you make it through it, you will find your ultimate happiness.
