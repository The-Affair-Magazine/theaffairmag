The number of cases in India continues to grow. The second wave of Covid-19 caused main cities in India to have very high losses. The subcontinent located in South Asia is included in the top 5 of the list of countries with the highest increase in Covid-19 death cases. India has had a spike in recent days, with more than 250,000 deaths. On the subject of Statistik Data, some analysis specialists are nonetheless debating the original number of Covid-19 infections. Some of them feel that the virus must have reached the interior of a country that has difficulty accessing virus testing and trancing tools. They worry that because it is very difficult to trace the scale of the pandemic in far-off areas of the country, it could be that the true number of deaths and infections is five to 10 times greater. 

Because of the many gliding cases of Covid-19 infection, hospitals in India have a deficit of beds, medical oxygen and medicines. Additionally, there's less than one doctor for every 1,000 people, and that figure is decreasing even more in rural areas and less populated states

Seeing the increasing number of cases, more than 40 countries are dedicated to helping India in overcoming the outbreak. If the case goes uphill, a national crisis with global impacts will be created. This potential outcome will endanger the development of other countries to overcome this pandemic.

In dealing with this case, the Government of India has rejected calls for a National Lockdown. In addition, Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s government allowed religious festivals and election rallies across the country at the start of the year. The Indian Prime Minister left most of the responsibility for fighting the outbreak to the state government, which, of course, has drawn a lot of criticism.

The Indian government says there is an adequate supply of oxygen, but the dissemination is hindered by transportation problems. United Arab Emirates, Germany, Singapore, France and multinational companies such as Amazon and Google are taking part in the distribution of this sufficiency. 

In terms of vaccinations, at the start of the pandemic, India was the largest vaccine producer in the World. They continue to produce more than 80 million doses a month. 
Even then, India was a major player in COVAX. In the past, India was obligated to supply 200 million doses of COVAX which were distributed to 92 poor countries. 
Seeing the current situation, India switched it and made the country a top priority for getting the COVAX dose. Because in reality, a country that is experiencing this critical state is not balanced with an adequate number of vaccines.

So far, nearly 10 percent of those in India have received the first vaccine but only about 1.5 percent have received both doses as needed. 

The Indian government has prepared an application for vaccination. So, Indian citizens who are over the age of 18, can register through the application. However, the app crashes due to overuse, and this, of course, is flooding Social Media.

Seeing that the Government has not commissioned vaccines in time, Adar Poonawalla, chief executive of the Serum Institute, stated that India's harsh shortages will carry on for months.
It can be concluded that getting out of the pandemic soon is beyond India's reach.
