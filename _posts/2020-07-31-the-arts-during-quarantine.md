How has the world of art adapted to having to shift to socially distanced standards?  

In lieu of recent events, the world has been in a standstill of sorts. The year twenty-twenty will be one for the history books. So much unprecedented change in so little time. One, a virus pandemic. Two, country-wide calls for stay at home orders; fueling a quarantine period. And more recently,  the re-heat up of the Black Lives Movement which furthered divides in the nation. 

Yet one constant has provided solace. Art. Though the world of art has also been on a hold of sorts, it has evolved into a steady platform that people across the world have used as a source of fuel for creativity. 

Art has always been an escape. Throughout time, it has helped many in releasing tensions and stress. And in the times of today, much of the world is facing increasing amounts of stress.  Quarantine has allowed artists and art-lovers alike more time to dedicate to their passions. However, art from before differs from the art of now.

The current circumstances have inspired many to recreate famous works of art (Barajas, 2020). These silly renditions have not only provided a source of entertainment but acted as an activity to fill up free time. 

Not only has the art world seen a humorous outlook on life, but it has also rekindled art forms that have gone obsolete over the years.

The concept of “Mail Art” began in 1950; artists would send their work privately through mail compared to physical galleries (Taub, 2020). In times where art galleries and other commodities involving close groups of people have been shut down, “Mail Art” saw a rise in participation.  

While the public has been resorting to art as a coping mechanism;, artists had to deal with extreme career changes. This didn’t stop them utilizing the extra time in immersing into their art forms. Eric Croes, an artist from Belgium, reflected on the sudden shift: “Instead of drowning myself in melancholy, I took advantage of the time to throw myself into my work” (Gassman, 2020). 

Arguably seen more this year than in past years, art has taken on a global perspective; gotten involved in cultural, social, and political spheres. Creative members in the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine adapted famous art pieces to COVID-19 precautions, proving that art speaks volumes (Looma, 2020).

It is a community that brings the world together, even in times of crisis.
