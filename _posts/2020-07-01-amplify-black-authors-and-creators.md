Education is one of the pillars of our society. But what happens if that education is built through an inherently racist lens? It then becomes our own job to educate ourselves on topics that might have been overlooked, misinterpreted, or downright falsified to portray a different message. What books can we read to take our education on the Black experience in America outside of the classroom? Here are some of the most informative and eye-opening books to get more educated about the long-term struggle of race relations in the US by Black authors of varied backgrounds:  

## Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates
Coates writes his book in a first person perspective in the form of a letter to his 15 year old son. It offers a unique, honest perspective on what it means to be Black in America. Because it is written for his son, he does not even unconsciously censor or soften the language to make it more digestible for white or non-Black readers.

If you're looking for answers, don't read this book.

If you're looking to grapple yourself with the questions of how to move forward, how to fight the racial injustice that still prevails, or how the system must change; if you're looking to delve into your own experiences; if you're looking to stare into the realistic problems currently faced by Black Americans—read this book.  

## This Will Be My Undoing: Living at the Intersection of Black, Female, and Feminist in (White) America by Morgan Jerkins 
Racism and sexism are issues discussed in mainstream American society; but for Black women, they don't just experience these two issues. For them, they experience prejudices for being born Black, for being born a woman, and for being born a Black woman. 

In Jerkins' series of essays, she does not only focus on one topic or one thread of the issue. She speaks on topics ranging from her experiences abroad, personal stories, revelations about the way Black women are expected to behave in society, and more. Her essays cannot be put into a box, and while they seem to be disconnected at points; that is a stylistic and meaningful choice made by Jerkins.

Her book is not "about all women, but it is meant for all women, and men, and those who do not adhere to the gender binary" (Jerkins, 2018). So if you fall under that category (you do...), read the book.  

## Well-Read Black Girl by Glory Edim 
What started as an online Instagram community and slowly evolved into a small book club is now a published book with a strong initiative centered around Black representation in literature. Even though Well-Read Black Girl is fragmented into different sections and essays, these individual stories are unified in common ideas and experiences.

I'm sure all of us have read a book that changed our life to some extent. A book that made us feel seen and understood by the world. For Black youth in the United States, it can often be hard to find a book that does this. To learn more about the importance of feeling seen in literature, read Glory Edim’s Well-Read Black Girl. We must support the stories of Black authors and creators.  

## An American Marriage by Tayari Jones 
Non-fiction books are not the only type of literature that illuminate the struggles of race relations. In fact, reading too many non-fiction books that focus on the systemic aspect of racism instead of the real people affected by it can make us lose sight of the human side of this issue. Tayari Jones’ An American Marriage is an example of a powerful fiction novel that humanizes the issue of racism. 

The book focuses on a Black married couple, Roy and Celestial. Roy is wrongfully imprisoned based on a crime he did not commit, and the story demonstrates how this illegitimate conviction affects Roy and Celestial’s relationship with each other  and the world around them.

Read this and put yourselves in the characters’ shoes. How would you feel if you were accused of a crime you did not commit? How would you feel if your spouse was locked away based on prejudiced beliefs? By asking yourself these questions, it will give you a view of the struggles Black Americans deal with in their lives. While it will never be the same as experiencing these events yourself, it can help you empathize and listen.  

## Don't Call Us Dead by Danez Smith 
What happens to the black boys who have their lives wrongly stolen from them at a young age by police brutality? Do they have an afterlife of peace? Do they finally reach a place that treats them fairly? Smith’s poetry creates a hypothetical scenario of happiness for the boys when they finally reach the utopian afterlife where they can live without being criminalized, but why does it have to be in Smith’s imagination? Why can’t that life exist for Black boys in America?

Smith’s poems focus on the way Black boys as well as the Black genderqueer community are affected by the racism in American society. They examine the communities that feel the brunt of violence, while also being unseen and unheard in mainstream society. How can these communities be simultaneously ignored and shamelessly persecuted?

Their book harshly calls out the violence and oppression faced by these communities through honest and uncensored poetry. The poems in this book cover topics that can be hard to swallow at times, starting out with the title Don’t Call Us Dead. But discomfort and brutal honesty can not be shied away from; the book openly discusses realities we must confront as a society.  


We all have the responsibility to inform ourselves about not only the events coming to the forefront of the news in regards to the Black Lives Matter movement, but also about the small ways in which we can educate ourselves about the racist system that allows these events to freely occur. We know you might have some more time on your hands during this stay at home period, so take advantage of that and learn! Read online if you do not have access to a bookstore, or purchase books online. 

While decreasing our own ignorance is not the only step needed to dismantle the racism ingrained in our society, it is a step we all have the power to take. Let’s get educated to eliminate ignorance in ourselves, our homes, and our communities.
